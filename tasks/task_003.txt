<info added on 2025-05-13T08:39:55.420Z>
Developed a comprehensive GraphQL data fetching layer with the following components:

1. **TypeScript Types**: Defined interfaces for WPPost, WPImage, WPTaxonomyNode, and response types for all queries, including PageInfo and connection types, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

2. **GraphQL Queries**: Implemented queries for posts, categories, tags, and site settings, with built-in pagination support and reusable fragments for maintainability and consistency.

3. **Service Layer**: Created a service layer with type-safe query functions, robust pagination handling, comprehensive error handling, and default configurations for common use cases.

4. **React Hooks**: Introduced custom hooks (usePosts, usePost, useCategories, useTags) with support for infinite loading, SSR, and initial data hydration, along with loading and error states for improved user experience.

Next steps include testing hooks in components, adding error boundaries, and implementing UI for loading states to ensure a resilient and user-friendly frontend.

<update timestamp="2025-05-13T08:39:49Z">
The data fetching layer now supports efficient, type-safe retrieval of WordPress content via GraphQL, with a focus on modularity, performance, and developer experience. Caching mechanisms and utility functions for common patterns have been integrated to optimize performance and reduce redundant requests. The layer is ready for integration with frontend components and further refinement based on real-world usage.

  - Implemented figure/figcaption handling for proper image captions and accessibility.

- **Frontmatter Generation:**
  - Added `generateFrontmatter` function to extract and format all relevant post metadata (title, dates, categories, tags, etc.).
  - Included reading time and word count metrics in the frontmatter for enhanced content analysis.

- **Test Implementation:**
  - Created an MDX test page (`src/app/mdx-test/page.tsx`) for validating the conversion pipeline.
  - Added component mapping for all WordPress blocks and implemented metadata display and styling.
  - Expanded test coverage to ensure edge cases are handled.

- **Content Structure and Relationships:**
  - Preserved content hierarchies, code syntax highlighting, responsive images, WordPress blocks, and shortcodes.
  - Maintained post metadata and frontmatter throughout the conversion process.

**Next Steps:**
- Add content sanitization for security.
- Implement caching for transformed data to optimize performance.
- Add error boundaries for resilient rendering.
- Expand test coverage for additional edge cases.

**Integration:**
- The pipeline is now ready for integration with the article rendering and indexing workflows, supporting future content management and analysis features.
