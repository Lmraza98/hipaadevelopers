<update><timestamp>2025-05-13T08:34:09Z</timestamp><content>Docker Compose configuration has been created for a secure WordPress 6.4 environment with PHP 8.2 and MariaDB 10.11. The setup includes Traefik as a reverse proxy for SSL/TLS termination, ensuring encrypted communication. Security best practices are implemented: sensitive credentials are managed via environment variables and .env files, with Docker secrets recommended for production; WordPress security constants (DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT, AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED) are set; container isolation and network security are enforced; and health checks are configured for all services. Persistent storage is ensured via volume mounts, and a backup script with retention policy is included. Next steps: copy docker/env.example to .env and fill in secure values, create necessary directories, and run docker compose up.</content></update>
